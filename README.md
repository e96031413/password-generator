This is a simple web application that generates random passwords based on user-specified criteria. The user can choose the length of the password (between 8 and 32 characters), and can choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols in the password.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file defines the structure of the application, the CSS file defines the styling, and the JavaScript file defines the functionality.

## How to Use
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Choose the desired password length using the number input.
3. Check the boxes next to the character types you want to include in your password.
4. Click the "Generate password" button to generate a random password.
5. If you want to copy the password to your clipboard, click the "Copy to clipboard" button.
## Technical Details
### HTML
The HTML file defines the structure of the application. There are two main sections:

- The "options" section, which contains the inputs for the password length and character types.
- The "password" section, which contains the output area for the generated password, as well as the buttons to generate a new password and copy the current password to the clipboard.
### CSS
The CSS file defines the styling of the application. The styling is fairly minimal, with a focus on readability and simplicity.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript file defines the functionality of the application. It does the following:

- Gets references to the necessary DOM elements (e.g. the password length input, the checkboxes for character types, etc.).
- Defines event listeners for the "Generate password" and "Copy to clipboard" buttons.
- Defines a function to generate a random password based on the user's input.
- Defines functions to generate random characters for each character type (i.e. uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
- Defines a function to copy the generated password to the user's clipboard.
## Conclusion
This password generator is a simple, yet useful, tool for generating random passwords. It is built using web technologies that many developers are familiar with, and can be easily modified to suit specific use cases.
